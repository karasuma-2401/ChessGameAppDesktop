He can step exactly one square in any direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. He captures enemy pieces the same way he moves, by landing on their square.However, the King has one golden rule: Safety First. He is never allowed to move to a square where an enemy piece can capture him (this is called moving into 'Check').There is one special exception to his slow movement called Castling. If the King and a Rook haven't moved yet, they can team up. The King slides two squares toward the Rook, and the Rook hops over him to stand guard by his side.

However, it cannot move diagonally, and it cannot jump over other pieces.

A Bishop is stuck on its starting color forever!

They are brave and can only move forward — never backward.The March: Usually, a Pawn moves just one square forward. However, on its very first move of the game, it has the option to charge two squares forward instead.The Attack: Pawns are unique because they don't capture the same way they move. A Pawn captures enemy pieces diagonally forward (one square). If an enemy is standing directly in front of a Pawn, the Pawn is blocked and cannot move or capture.The Reward: If a Pawn makes it all the way to the other side of the board, it gets a promotion! It instantly transforms into any other piece you want (usually a Queen)." },
